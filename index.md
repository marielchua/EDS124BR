# I'm Mariel Chua!
## Welcome to my Teaching Portfolio for EDS124BR!

I'm a third year student at UCSD studying [Computer Science](https://marielchua.github.io/GitHub-Pages/#why-i-chose-cs)! This is the page where I will 
keep the lessons I create in the class EDS124BR for now. I'm hoping to eventually move this to a more professional site once I finish the class!
