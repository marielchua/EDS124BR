# I'm Mariel Chua!
## Welcome to my Teaching Portfolio for EDS124BR!

I'm a third year student at UCSD studying [Computer Science](https://marielchua.github.io/EDS124BR/#why-i-chose-cs)! This is the page where I will 
keep the lessons I create in the class EDS124BR for now. I'm hoping to eventually move this to a more professional site once I finish the class!

## Why I Chose CS
I hope to go into game development one day with my CS career, since I really like videogames (I recently have been really liking [Kirby](https://youtu.be/XBvRzwXxzSQ) and FFXIV!). However, I also just want any job that lets me be a part of programming interesting and useful things.  
I think taking EDS124BR will be useful because learning how to teach CS might help me figure out how I learn too! I'm very excited to share my work.
